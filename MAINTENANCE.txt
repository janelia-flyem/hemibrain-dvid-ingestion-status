Github will automatically render markdown files into html for the repo wiki,
but sometimes it's nice to see your changes locally before committing them to github.

To render the markdown files locally:

gem install commonmarker
gem install github-markup

# Generate all .html files (dumped to html/)
./render.sh

# Generate one .html file
./render.sh Home.md

(Do not commit the rendered html files.)

(Some features, like checkboxes, will cannot be rendered locally.)

Hint: Markdown tables are easer to write/edit using an online tool:
